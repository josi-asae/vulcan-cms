# About
This is the source code for a proof-of-concept JSON editor written in PolymerJS and hosted with Firebase. See https://vulcancms.firebaseapp.com for a demo.

With this tool you can upload a formatted JSON, preview what it would look like in an app configured to the JSON shape, edit the content, save, and load documents.
